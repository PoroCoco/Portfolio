This project was developed in team of 4 students. I led my team's software architecture and optimisations which, in addition to our advanced heuristics, made us win the competition against 28 other teams' AIs. KCacheGrind and Gprof were used for the needed optimisations as winning an Amazons game is a PSPACE-complete problem. The board is represented as a sparse matrix using GSL. Full report avaible: <a href=\"/ressources/pdf/report_amazons_fr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">French</a>.<br>I made my own web port using WebAssembly.",
